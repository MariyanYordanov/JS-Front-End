/*
9. JavaScript Quizz *

Write a function that has the functionality of a quiz.
Three sections contain one question and 2 possible answers.
The right answer is only one!
When one of the list elements is clicked, the next section must appear (if any…).
After all three questions have been answered, the results ul must appear, 
(Use 'none' and 'block' to hide and show the question sections), and the results must be added in the h1.

If all questions are answered correctly, you should print the following message: 
"You are recognized as top JavaScript fan!"

Otherwise, just print "You have {rightAnswers} right answers".

The right answers are:
· onclick
· JSON.stringify()
· A programming API for HTML and XML documents

function solve() {
  //TODO...
}
